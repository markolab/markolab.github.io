## Understanding how the brain gives rise to action


Animals and humans alike are able to thrive in a chaotic and sometimes dangerous world through their ability to select the appropriate action among myriad alternatives. Each moment in time, the animal takes stock of its internal state and the external world to select a given behavior. We seek to understand this fundamental process in the lab using the mouse as a model organism. 

Our primary approach is to perform 3D motion capture of a mouse as it freely explores a large arena using a variety of sensors – this is used to build a dense point cloud of the animal. Then, we use fully unsupervised probabilistic time-series models to segment the motion capture data into discrete behaviors, for instance running, rearing, grooming, or turning. At the same time, we read and write neural activity primarily using electrophysiology, functional imaging, and optogenetics.  


## Developing new approaches to brain stimulation 


Many of the brain areas central to action selection are also a focal point for Parkinson's disease – a disease that impacts nearly 6 million people worldwide. In the lab, we are developing real-time algorithms to identify both behaviors and brain states in real-time, which can be used to shape stimulation parameters in the moment. We aim to use this approach to pave the way towards new, closed-loop approaches to therapeutic neuromodulation.
